### hi

This is the latest version of my site. It is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), and the content is authored in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and stored in a private repo.

Images hosted on Pinata IPFS.

The site is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), and I'm using [PostHog](https://posthog.com/) for some basic analytics.

> The code is provided as-is, and I'm not planning to provide support for this setup. Feel free to use it as inspiration for your own projects.
