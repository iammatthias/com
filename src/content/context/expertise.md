## Philosophy

**Growth Engineering:** Most marketing problems are engineering problems in disguise. Build systems that scale, measure everything that matters, optimize relentlessly.

**Photography:** Document honestly, compose deliberately, share generously. The best photos happen when you're present and prepared.

**Life:** You can just build things that work. Whether it's a marketing funnel or a photograph, start with what matters and optimize from there.
