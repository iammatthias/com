## Current Work

**day---break** (Owner) | August 2024 - Present

- 25% average customer LTV increase through ML/AI implementation

### Services

- Customer lifecycle engineering and automation
- Marketing technology stack integration and data architecture
- Conversion funnel optimization and systematic A/B testing
- Revenue attribution modeling and advanced analytics

### Photography

Fine-art photographer available for commisions and prints. I shoot landscapes, portraits, and commercial work. My primary camera is a Canon EOS R, but I also use a variety of old film cameras (Canon AE-1, Canon EF, Hasselblad 500C). My primary camera is the one I have with me most of the time, my iPhone. Select work can be viewed at my website [iammatthias.com/art](https://iammatthias.com/art) and on Glass [@iammatthias](https://glass.photo/iam).
