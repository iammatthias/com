# IAMMATTHIAS
## A digital garden 

### What is this 
This is a digital garden. A constantly evolving space on the web that is my own. 

Previous versions have been built with [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), [Harp](http://harpjs.com/), [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), and most recently, [Next](https://nextjs.org/). 

The unifying thread has been building around image galleries for displaying my photography. Until recently there has not been any sort of financial model built in to the content. 

As of 10/2022 I began a rebuild from the ground up. The plan is to move away from my old CMS model with Contentful, and into a new paradigm. 

### So how does it work 
We are publishing content on Paragraph, which stores content on Arweave. This can be retrieved permissionlessly as JSON, and rendered accordingly. 

An example can be viewed here: [https://uatlkfhduv557htv5luvhpacwp6asrkg33u4swwrpzxtsm6mt3ia.arweave.net/oCa1FOOle9-ederpU7wCs_wJRUbe6cla0X5vOTPMntA](https://uatlkfhduv557htv5luvhpacwp6asrkg33u4swwrpzxtsm6mt3ia.arweave.net/oCa1FOOle9-ederpU7wCs_wJRUbe6cla0X5vOTPMntA)
